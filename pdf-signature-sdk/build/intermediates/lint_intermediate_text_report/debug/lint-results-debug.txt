/Users/onur/AndroidStudioProjects/pdfsignaturesdk/pdf-signature-sdk/build.gradle.kts:44: Warning: A newer version of androidx.core:core-ktx than 1.9.0 is available: 1.15.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.9.0")
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/onur/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.bouncycastle/bcpkix-jdk15to18/1.72/32faf4d74dbc333fb3a7a6c80c30417cf888fc7a/bcpkix-jdk15to18-1.72.jar: Warning: checkServerTrusted is empty, which could cause insecure network traffic due to trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers [TrustAllX509TrustManager]

   Explanation for issues of type "TrustAllX509TrustManager":
   This check looks for X509TrustManager implementations whose
   checkServerTrusted or checkClientTrusted methods do nothing (thus trusting
   any certificate chain) which could result in insecure network traffic
   caused by trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers.

/Users/onur/AndroidStudioProjects/pdfsignaturesdk/pdf-signature-sdk/src/main/java/com/okamikosoft/pdf_signature_sdk/customView/SignatureView.kt:31: Warning: Custom view SignatureView overrides onTouchEvent but not performClick [ClickableViewAccessibility]
    override fun onTouchEvent(event: MotionEvent): Boolean {
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ClickableViewAccessibility":
   If a View that overrides onTouchEvent or uses an OnTouchListener does not
   also implement performClick and call it when clicks are detected, the View
   may not handle accessibility actions properly. Logic handling the click
   actions should ideally be placed in View#performClick as some accessibility
   services invoke performClick when a click action should occur.

/Users/onur/AndroidStudioProjects/pdfsignaturesdk/pdf-signature-sdk/src/main/res/layout/fragment_pdf_signature.xml:29: Warning: Hardcoded string "Save File", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="Save File"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
