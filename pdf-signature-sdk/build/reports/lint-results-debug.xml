        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        category="Accessibility"
        priority="6"
        summary="Accessibility in Custom Views"
        explanation="If a `View` that overrides `onTouchEvent` or uses an `OnTouchListener` does not also implement `performClick` and call it when clicks are detected, the `View` may not handle accessibility actions properly. Logic handling the click actions should ideally be placed in `View#performClick` as some accessibility services invoke `performClick` when a click action should occur."

        summary="Hardcoded text"
        explanation="Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons:&#xA;&#xA;* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)&#xA;&#xA;* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.&#xA;&#xA;There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."
