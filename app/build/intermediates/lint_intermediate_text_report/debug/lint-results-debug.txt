/Users/onur/.gradle/caches/transforms-3/aaebb248841070133e528bab90cec6c2/transformed/lifecycle-livedata-core-2.8.7/jars/lint.jar: Warning: Library lint checks reference invalid APIs; these checks will be skipped!

Lint found an issue registry (androidx.lifecycle.lint.LiveDataCoreIssueRegistry)
which contains some references to invalid API:
org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.session.KtAnalysisSessionProvider: org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.lifetime.KtLifetimeTokenFactory getTokenFactory()
(Referenced from androidx/lifecycle/lint/NonNullableMutableLiveDataDetector$createUastHandler$1.class)

Therefore, this lint check library is not included
in analysis. This affects the following lint checks:
NullSafeMutableLiveData

To use this lint check, upgrade to a more recent version
of the library. [ObsoleteLintCustomCheck]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLintCustomCheck":
   Lint can be extended with "custom checks": additional checks implemented by
   developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages
   required by a library or a company coding style guideline.

   The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a
   performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.

   This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete
   APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.

   It may also flag issues found to be using a newer version of the API,
   meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or
   Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

/Users/onur/AndroidStudioProjects/pdfsignaturesdk/app/build.gradle.kts:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 33
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

/Users/onur/AndroidStudioProjects/pdfsignaturesdk/app/build.gradle.kts:48: Warning: A newer version of androidx.core:core-ktx than 1.9.0 is available: 1.15.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.9.0")
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/onur/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.bouncycastle/bcpkix-jdk15to18/1.72/32faf4d74dbc333fb3a7a6c80c30417cf888fc7a/bcpkix-jdk15to18-1.72.jar: Warning: checkServerTrusted is empty, which could cause insecure network traffic due to trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers [TrustAllX509TrustManager]

   Explanation for issues of type "TrustAllX509TrustManager":
   This check looks for X509TrustManager implementations whose
   checkServerTrusted or checkClientTrusted methods do nothing (thus trusting
   any certificate chain) which could result in insecure network traffic
   caused by trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers.

    <string name="title_activity_main">MainActivity</string>

/Users/onur/AndroidStudioProjects/pdfsignaturesdk/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml:5: Warning: The resource R.string.hello_blank_fragment appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
    <string name="hello_blank_fragment">Hello blank fragment</string>
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
