        id="ObsoleteLintCustomCheck"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Library lint checks reference invalid APIs; these checks **will be skipped**!&#xA;&#xA;Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.lifecycle.lint.LiveDataCoreIssueRegistry`)&#xA;which contains some references to invalid API:&#xA;org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.session.KtAnalysisSessionProvider: org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.lifetime.KtLifetimeTokenFactory getTokenFactory()&#xA;(Referenced from androidx/lifecycle/lint/NonNullableMutableLiveDataDetector$createUastHandler$1.class)&#xA;&#xA;Therefore, this lint check library is **not** included&#xA;in analysis. This affects the following lint checks:&#xA;`NullSafeMutableLiveData`&#xA;&#xA;To use this lint check, upgrade to a more recent version&#xA;of the library."

        priority="10"
        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.">

        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"

        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release.
